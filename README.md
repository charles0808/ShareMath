## Project Info

ShareMath is an online math formula editor and sharing platform. Users
can create their private formula snippets with attached markdown
documentation. Users can make a snippet public to share with others.
They can also generate a link to the rendered image version of their
formulas to make it easy to attach them on other websites.

We would also provide search feature to help users looking for others
formulas. Users can create private collections to save the formulas.
We will also count on the number of times a formula is saved and
provide it as a rating measure to the public.
